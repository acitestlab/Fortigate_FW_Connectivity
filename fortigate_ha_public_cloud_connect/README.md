The VPN setup in your workspace is designed to establish a secure connection between a FortiGate HA firewall and a public cloud environment (e.g., Azure or AWS). Here's an explanation of the key components and configurations involved:

1.  FortiGate HA Configuration
The FortiGate HA setup is defined in the fortigate_ha_config directory. It includes the following:

Interfaces Configuration
    DMZ Interface: Configured with the IP address 192.168.10.1/24 and allows access via ping, https, and ssh.
    Internal Interface: Configured with the IP address 192.168.20.1/24 and allows access via ping, https, and ssh.
    External Interface: Configured with the IP address 192.168.30.1/24 and allows access via ping, https, and ssh.

Routing
    A static route is configured to route all traffic (0.0.0.0/0) through the WAN router at 192.168.30.254 via the external interface.

OSPF Configuration
    OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is enabled for dynamic routing. The DMZ, internal, and external subnets are added to the OSPF area 0.0.0.0.

Outputs
    The IP addresses of the DMZ, internal, and external interfaces are exposed as outputs for verification.

2. VPN Configuration
The VPN setup is not explicitly defined in the fortigate_ha_config directory but is likely part of the fortigate_ha_public_cloud_connect directory (e.g., fortigate_ha_azure_cloud_connect or fortigate_aws_vpn). Here's how the VPN would typically be configured:

Phase 1 (IKE)
    Remote Gateway: The public IP of the Azure or AWS VPN gateway.
    Authentication: Pre-shared key (PSK) for secure communication.
    Encryption: Algorithms like AES256 and SHA256 for secure data exchange.
    DPD (Dead Peer Detection): Ensures the VPN connection is alive.

Phase 2 (IPSec)
    Traffic Selectors: Define the local and remote subnets that will communicate over the VPN.
    Encryption: Similar to Phase 1, using AES256 and SHA256.

Firewall Policies
    Policies are created to allow traffic between the local subnets (e.g., DMZ, internal) and the remote subnets (e.g., Azure or AWS).

3. Azure or AWS VPN Gateway
The public cloud environment (Azure or AWS) is configured to establish the other end of the VPN tunnel. This includes:

Azure
    A Virtual Network Gateway is created with a public IP and connected to the Azure VNet.
    The FortiGate's external IP is configured as the remote gateway in Azure.

AWS
    A Customer Gateway is created with the FortiGate's external IP.
    A Virtual Private Gateway is attached to the AWS VPC.
    A Site-to-Site VPN connection is established between the Customer Gateway and the Virtual Private Gateway.

4. Automation
The Terraform configurations and Python scripts in your workspace automate the setup:

    Terraform: Provisions the FortiGate firewall, interfaces, routing, and VPN configuration.
    Python Scripts: Automate the execution of Terraform commands (init, plan, apply) to deploy the infrastructure.

5. Verification
After the setup, you can verify the VPN connection by checking:

    The interface IPs (outputs from outputs.tf).
    The VPN status on the FortiGate dashboard.
    Connectivity between the local and remote subnets.
